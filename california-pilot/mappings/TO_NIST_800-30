## NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Scaffold (Applied)

| 800-30 Element | CCSM | HPD | Pilot |
|---|---|---|---|
| Threat sources/events | constitutional risk triggers (overreach, opacity) | operational threats (unauthorized access, unverifiable decisions) | observed institutional failure modes |
| Vulnerabilities | missing reviewability, proxy authority | weak custody, absent logs, automation outranking humans | missing records, inconsistent process, unclear authority |
| Likelihood | expressed as governance conditions (not probabilities) | context-based, scenario-driven | evidenced by repeated observation patterns |
| Impact | rights harm, legitimacy loss | operational harm + accountability failure | documented harm/denial/confusion outcomes |
| Risk determination | “constitutional risk” classification | governance recommendation severity | exhibits that demonstrate realized risk |
