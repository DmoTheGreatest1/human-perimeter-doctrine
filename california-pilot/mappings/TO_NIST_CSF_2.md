## California Pilot → NIST CSF 2.0 (Non-binding mapping)

| Pilot Artifact Type | CSF 2.0 Function(s) | Why it maps |
|---|---|---|
| Requests, correspondence logs, case timeline | GOVERN, IDENTIFY | demonstrates governance process and visibility gaps |
| Redacted exhibits / records | IDENTIFY, PROTECT | highlights custody, stewardship, and access issues |
| Observed failure modes (missing logs, unclear authority) | IDENTIFY, DETECT | shows where detection/auditability fails in practice |
| Non-enforcement stance (no demands) | GOVERN | preserves boundary discipline; avoids operational intrusion |
