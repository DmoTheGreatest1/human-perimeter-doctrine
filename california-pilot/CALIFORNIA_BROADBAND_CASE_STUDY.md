# California Broadband Subsidy Case Study

HPD is non-proprietary and free to read, cite, fork, and reference.

Payment is required only when an institution operationalizes HPD as a
relied-upon governance program.

Speech is free.
Use is funded.

If HPD is used to touch money, delay money, release money, or justify
why money moved, the institution must fund the reliance.

Funding includes:
- internal oversight
- human decision-makers
- stewardship recognition

HPD does not invoice, negotiate, enforce, or collect.

Visibility is the accountability mechanism.
