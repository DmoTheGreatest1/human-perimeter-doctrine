# California Broadband Pilot
## What Changes / What Doesn’t

Status: INFORMATIVE · NON-ENFORCING · PILOT-SPECIFIC

This document is provided to help executives, CTOs, procurement officers,
and legal reviewers quickly understand the practical impact of applying
the Human Perimeter Doctrine (HPD) to a California broadband subsidy context.

This pilot does not introduce new enforcement authority, penalties,
or surveillance mechanisms.

---

## What Changes

### 1. Accounting Becomes Evidence-Based

Subsidy disbursement decisions are supported by **verifiable artifacts**
rather than narrative reports alone.

- Vendor claims
- Recipient acknowledgments
- Independent network or infrastructure telemetry

These artifacts are reconciled before funds are finalized.

**Effect:**  
Faster audits, fewer disputes, clearer records.

---

### 2. Settlement Timing Reflects Data Integrity

Payments move faster when evidence is consistent.
They slow only when discrepancies exist.

There are:
- no new penalties
- no retroactive clawbacks
- no automated punishments

**Effect:**  
Clean accounting becomes a cash-flow advantage.

---

### 3. Human Judgment Is Explicit (Not Hidden)

When automated reconciliation fails, a **named human decision-maker**
must resolve the issue using the Ring-0 process.

- Binary outcome (ratify or reject)
- Written rationale
- Permanent, append-only record

**Effect:**  
Clear responsibility without expanding bureaucracy.

---

### 4. Energy Efficiency Can Surface as a Windfall

Because reconciliation relies on physical network evidence,
inefficiencies (over-provisioning, phantom capacity, idle draw)
become visible **without mandates**.

This enables:
- voluntary optimization
- operational cost savings
- energy reductions as a byproduct, not a requirement

**Effect:**  
Efficiency gains emerge naturally, not through regulation.

---

### 5. Public Transparency Improves Without Exposure

Aggregated reporting becomes clearer while:
- raw logs remain with operators
- no sensitive operational details are published
- FOIA responses are simpler and safer

**Effect:**  
Transparency increases without compromising security.

---

## What Does NOT Change

### 1. No New Enforcement Powers

HPD does NOT:
- issue fines
- suspend vendors
- impose penalties
- mandate participation
- override agency authority

All enforcement authority remains exactly where it already exists.

---

### 2. No New Surveillance

HPD does NOT:
- require continuous monitoring
- centralize raw network logs
- introduce new data collection obligations

Only cryptographic summaries are exchanged.

---

### 3. No Mandatory Technology Stack

Agencies and vendors:
- keep existing infrastructure
- integrate via sidecar or export
- retain full system autonomy

HPD is a governance overlay, not a platform replacement.

---

### 4. No Vendor Lock-In

All formats are:
- documented
- forkable
- non-proprietary

Any participant may exit without penalty.

---

### 5. No Punitive Posture

This pilot is not designed to “catch” or “punish” participants.

It is designed to:
- reduce accounting friction
- improve settlement confidence
- make public spending legible

---

## Plain English Summary

HPD does not add power.
It adds **clarity**.

HPD does not punish.
It makes discrepancies visible.

HPD does not mandate efficiency.
It lets efficiency pay for itself.

---

## Pilot Scope Reminder

This document describes a **hypothetical application** of HPD
to California broadband subsidy administration.

It does not imply:
- state adoption
- agency endorsement
- operational deployment

Reading, citing, or discussing this pilot remains free and non-binding.
