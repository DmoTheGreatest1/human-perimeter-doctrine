# Stewardship Compensation Notice

Status: CANONICAL · FINAL · NON-PROPRIETARY

## Purpose

This notice clarifies the distinction between free public use of the
Human Perimeter Doctrine (HPD) as speech and the obligations that arise
when an institution chooses operational reliance on HPD.

## Stewardship Defined

HPD exists as a public framework due to ongoing human stewardship,
including but not limited to:

- Original authorship of the doctrine
- Maintenance of canonical documentation
- Hash anchoring and version control
- Boundary definition and doctrinal clarity
- Availability of reference implementations

This stewardship constitutes real human labor.

## Operational Reliance and Compensation

If an institution chooses to rely on HPD operationally in a
decision-bearing workflow (including financial settlement, resource
allocation, or adjudication of rights):

- The institution must fund the operational reliance.
- Such funding includes both:
  - Internal human oversight costs, and
  - Fair compensation recognizing HPD stewardship.

## Resolution of Compensation

- The form, amount, and administration of any stewardship compensation
  are determined entirely by the adopting institution.
- Resolution may occur through internal budgeting, direct engagement,
  or privately mediated processes.
- HPD does not set prices, collect fees, negotiate terms, invoice,
  audit, or enforce compensation.

## Visibility as Accountability

HPD does not enforce compliance with this notice.

If an institution:
- Claims operational reliance on HPD, and
- Funds internal oversight, but
- Does not address stewardship compensation,

the append-only record will reflect that choice.

Visibility, not enforcement, is the accountability mechanism.

## Non-Proprietary Nature

Nothing in this notice:
- Restricts speech, citation, or forking
- Creates a licensing requirement
- Establishes price control or collection authority
- Implies supervisory or enforcement power

HPD remains a public, fork-safe governance standard.
