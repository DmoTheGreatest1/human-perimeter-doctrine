# Canonical Primitive: Triple-Entry Settlement via Verifiable Capacity

Status: CANONICAL · ECONOMIC PRIMITIVE · NON-PROPRIETARY · FROZEN

This document defines the economic and accounting primitive by which
capacity provision is settled using three independent sources of truth:

- Vendor service logs
- Counterparty cryptographic receipts
- Independent physical network telemetry

It is intentionally written for executive finance and infrastructure
audiences and avoids protocol, blockchain, or governance jargon.

Disputes that cannot be resolved through automated reconciliation
are frozen and resolved through the Ring-0 Finalization Terminal,
where a human Responsible Officer renders a binary decision.
