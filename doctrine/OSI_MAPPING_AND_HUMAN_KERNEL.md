# OSI Mapping and Human Kernel

Status: CANONICAL · FROZEN · NON-OPERATIONAL

This document defines the Human Perimeter Doctrine (HPD) at the
architectural level by mapping human authority and accountability
onto a layered systems model analogous to OSI.

HPD introduces a Human Kernel that exists outside automated systems
and is invoked only when machine reconciliation fails.

Layers below the Human Kernel may be automated.
The Human Kernel is not.

Key properties:

- Humans are accountable, named, and time-bound
- Decisions are attestable, not silent
- Automation may assist but never override
- Authority collapses upward only on conflict

This document is descriptive, not executable.
Operational reliance is defined elsewhere.

## Canonical Economic Primitive

The foundational settlement primitive for HPD is defined in:

- CANONICAL_PRIMITIVE_TRIPLE_ENTRY_SETTLEMENT.md

This document specifies how verified capacity becomes money using
triple-entry reconciliation (Vendor, Client, Physical Telemetry).
