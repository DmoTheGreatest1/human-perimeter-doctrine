# Mapping Methodology (Non-Binding)

These mappings are provided for interpretive and interoperability purposes only.

They are:
- Non-enforcing
- Non-certifying
- Non-operational
- Non-binding

Mappings express conceptual alignment and vocabulary correspondence only.
They do not assert compliance, implementation, authority, or endorsement.

Negative-space posture:
This repository intentionally documents boundaries, gaps, and governance conditions
without prescribing remediation, controls, or enforcement actions.
