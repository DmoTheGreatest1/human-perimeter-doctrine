## EO 13636 → (CCSM/HPD/Pilot) Relationship

EO 13636 is treated as a policy origin signal that normalizes cybersecurity as critical infrastructure governance.
This repository does not claim EO authority or enforcement. Mapping is conceptual:

- EO 13636 → motivates a shared risk vocabulary (CSF) for CI operators and partners.
- CCSM → provides constitutional constraint logic for governance claims (meta-layer).
- HPD → offers voluntary governance recommendations aligned with accountability and custody.
- Pilot → provides field evidence of governance gaps without enforcement.
