# Ring-0 Do Not Modify Covenant

Status: CANONICAL · LOCKED

Ring-0 SHALL NOT be modified, softened, abstracted, replaced, or
reinterpreted.

No summaries, dashboards, AI agents, or delegated proxies may
substitute for Ring-0 authority.

Any attempt to implement HPD while bypassing or weakening Ring-0
constitutes governance drift and will be visible on the record.

This covenant is absolute.
