# Canonical Ring-0 Finalization Terminal

Status: CANONICAL · FROZEN · ASYMMETRIC

Ring-0 is the final human authority layer.

It exists to resolve irreducible discrepancies between:
- Source A (vendor claims)
- Source B (counterparty receipts)
- Source C (physical or telemetry anchor)

Ring-0 decisions are:
- binary
- attributable
- timestamped
- irreversible

Ring-0 is intentionally slow, severe, and unpleasant.
It is designed to resist convenience, negotiation, and discretion.

This terminal may not be automated.
This terminal may not be simulated.
This terminal may not be bypassed.
