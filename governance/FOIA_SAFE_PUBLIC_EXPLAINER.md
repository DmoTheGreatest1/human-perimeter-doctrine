What This Document Is
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This document explains, in plain language, what the Human Perimeter
Doctrine (HPD) is and is not.

It is written for public understanding and is suitable for disclosure
under public records laws.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
What HPD Is
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HPD is a governance framework that helps institutions document how
important decisions are made when money, resources, or public services
are involved.

It emphasizes:
- evidence over argument
- documentation over discretion
- human responsibility over automation

HPD does not make decisions. It documents them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
What Problem It Addresses
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Large public programs often face:
- slow payments
- disputed claims
- expensive audits
- unclear accountability
- politicized disagreements

HPD provides a way to record decisions clearly so disagreements can be
resolved with facts rather than narratives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works (High Level)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Most routine processes are handled automatically using existing data.

If the data aligns, nothing special happens.

If the data conflicts, the process pauses and a human decision-maker
records a clear explanation of what happened and why a decision was
made.

That explanation becomes part of the permanent record.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
What HPD Does NOT Do
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HPD does not:
- punish participants
- impose fines
- claw back funds
- monitor individuals
- collect private data
- replace existing laws
- add new regulatory powers

HPD does not enforce outcomes.
It documents choices.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Is This a Surveillance System?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

No.

HPD does not collect raw operational data, personal information, or
content.

Institutions retain their own data.
Only summaries or confirmations are used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Is This a New Technology Platform?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

No.

HPD is not a software product, service, or vendor platform.

It is a documentation and governance standard that can be implemented
using existing systems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Does This Cost Money?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading, discussing, or referencing HPD is free.

If an institution chooses to rely on HPD in real operational decisions,
that institution funds the work internally using its normal budgeting
processes.

HPD does not set prices or collect payments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Why This Is Not Punitive
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HPD is designed to:
- reduce disputes
- speed up legitimate payments
- lower audit costs
- improve planning accuracy

It is not designed to penalize participants or assign blame.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Public Benefit
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When adopted, HPD can:
- make public spending easier to explain
- reduce costly back-and-forth disputes
- improve trust through documentation
- surface efficiency opportunities

In some cases, this can reveal energy or resource savings as a
byproduct of better accounting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bottom Line
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HPD does not change who has authority.
It makes how authority is exercised visible.
